The DriverPass project was one where we created UML diagrams and attempted to understand what the business needed and wanted based on given information including a meeting transcript. I believe I did a good job understanding what the consumer wanted including vital features. One thing I would of done differently is being more detail oriented in the creation of mydeisgn diagrams. Designing software should follow a similar approach as I took. It is important to understand thee wants of the consumer to help guide you in making the software. It is also important once understadnign this to make a clear design diagram (or diagrams) to illustrate what your program will do, and how it runs. This will help both technical and nontechinical people understand what it is you are attempting to complete.
